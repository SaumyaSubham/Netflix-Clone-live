# Netflix-Clone-live
Today, I will be building a fully responsive Netflix landing page clone using HTML5, CSS, and Javascript. Here I used TMDB Api for backend supports. Some of features are not goes well due to no database so basically, It's a frontend design of the Netflix.

⭐ Main Agenda of this project:-
👉 Getting movies info through TMDB Api 🌐
👉 Building a Netflix Clone App using HTML, CSS, and Javascript 💻
👉 Make it responsive ⭐
👉 Deploying an app with Hosting on GitHub 🌐
